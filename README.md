# Build_your_own_site

In this exercise I had to create my own webpage and use all what I learnt in Codecademy.

There were some requirement I had to fulfill: 

1. The page should contain at least 3 subpages.
2. Its html should be W3C valid.
3. It should contain properly used HTML5 (new) elements
4. It should contain a navigation menu
5. It should contain a contact page with a form to send email to the author (I don't need to create server side logic, only the front       end) with input validation
